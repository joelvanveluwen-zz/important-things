# Important things with Joel

_Just a list of important data science stuff_ 

## Project management / lifecycle

*Cookie cutter data science templating*<br><br>
[https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)<br><br>
Why? Data Science is a terrible profession when it comes to standardisation and reproducibility (because junior practictioners typically don't learn to plan for scale or common use). This is pretty hilarious given 'science' in the title on the profession. Cookie Cutter is something I have found to be 'as close' as we can get to software development project management. You don't need to be that strict about it but it is definitely a good start.

*Knowledge repositories*<br><br>

Why? Knowledge management is a pain. This tool is an awesome way to reduce some of the pain. It takes R markdown and Jupyter notebook and generates a hostable, light weight blogging platform so you can transfer knowledge and methodology to other people. Use this tool! 

## Machine learning and associated pipelines

### Distributed 

*Photon ML*<br><Br>
[https://github.com/linkedin/photon-ml](https://github.com/linkedin/photon-ml)<br><br>
This thing is cool. It is cool because it is fast, scales very well and typically performs better than your SparkML equivalent. Minus 10 points though for forcing you to use AVRO. This is used in one form or another at LinkedIn for production scale ML so check it out.

### Local

*Yellowbrick (and sklearn)*<Br><Br>
[https://github.com/DistrictDataLabs/yellowbrick](https://github.com/DistrictDataLabs/yellowbrick)<Br><Br>
This is the best thing I have seen all year. It adds a set of visualisers that extend and make working with scikit about 40x more pleasant. If you want quick discovery and model exploration this is a life saver. Even cooler if you're addicted to XGboost [this great human even wrote a blog on extending to that!](https://rebeccabilbro.github.io/xgboost-and-yellowbrick/).
  
## To add

* Jupyter skins
* Jupyter lab
* Pythonpptx wrapper
* Dr Elephant
* Some azure stuff on botframework
