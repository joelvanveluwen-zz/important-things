_Just a list of important data science stuff_ 

## Project management / lifecycle

*Cookie cutter data science templating*

Why? Data Science is a terrible profession when it comes to standardisation and reproducibility. This is pretty hilarious given 'science' in the title on the profession. Cookie Cutter is something I have found to be 'as close' as we can get to software development project management. You don't need to be that strict about it but it is definitely a good start.

*Knowledge repositories*

Why? Knowledge management is a pain. This tool is an awesome way to reduce some of the pain. It takes R markdown and Jupyter notebook and generates a hostable, light weight blogging platform so you can transfer knowledge and methodology to other people. Use this tool!
