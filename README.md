_Just a list of important data science stuff_ 

## Project management / lifecycle

*Cookie cutter data science templating*<br>

Why? Data Science is a terrible profession when it comes to standardisation and reproducibility (because junior practictioners typically don't learn to plan for scale or common use). This is pretty hilarious given 'science' in the title on the profession. Cookie Cutter is something I have found to be 'as close' as we can get to software development project management. You don't need to be that strict about it but it is definitely a good start.

*Knowledge repositories*<br>

Why? Knowledge management is a pain. This tool is an awesome way to reduce some of the pain. It takes R markdown and Jupyter notebook and generates a hostable, light weight blogging platform so you can transfer knowledge and methodology to other people. Use this tool!
